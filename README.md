# DriveUp-Front 
Welcome to the frontend repository of our final project "DriveUp". 
# About DriveUp
The project aims to develop a generic solution for the Knapsack problem and implement it in a mobile application called DriveUp, which is designed to optimize transportation services in the taxi sector. The application aims to maximize driver's profit, minimize passenger's cost, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
DriveUp offers drivers the option to merge different nearby rides, allowing them to serve more passengers in the same period. This helps save time and earn more money for the drivers while also reducing the number of private cars on the roads, thus reducing gas pollution and traffic congestion.
